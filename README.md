## üîÑ Update

To update the current Open Voice OS instance, backup your `~/.config/mycroft/mycroft.conf` or `~/ovos/config/mycroft.conf` _(only if required)_ and re-run installer but answer **"No"** to the _"Do you want to uninstall Open Voice OS?"_ question.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Start & Stop the services

When the `virtualenv` method as being choose _(default)_ during the installation process, few systemd unit files have being created in order to manages the different components as services.

### üìã List the systemd unit files

```shell
systemctl --user list-units "*ovos*"
systemctl list-units "*ovos*"
```

Only one service is running as `root`; `ovos-phal-admin`.

### üü¢ Start Open Voice OS

```shell
systemctl --user start ovos
sudo systemctl start ovos-phal-admin
```

### üî¥ Stop Open Voice OS

```shell
systemctl --user stop ovos
sudo systemctl stop ovos-phal-admin
```

## ü§ñ Automated install

The installer supports a non-interactive _(automated)_ process of installation by using a scenario file, this file must be created under the `~/.config/ovos-installer/` directory and should be named `scenario.yaml`.

Here is an example of a scenario to install Open Voice OS within Docker containers on a Raspberry Pi 4B with default skills and GUI support.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/ovos-installer
cat <<EOF > ~/.config/ovos-installer/scenario.yaml
---
uninstall: false
method: containers
channel: development
profile: ovos
features:
  skills: true
  extra_skills: false
  gui: true
rapsberry_pi_tuning: true
share_telemetry: true
share_usage_telemetry: true
EOF
```

Few scenarios are available as example in the [scenarios](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer/tree/main/scenarios) directory of this repository.

## ‚ùå Uninstall

To uninstall Open Voice OS run the installer with the `--uninstall` option _(non-interactive)_ or simply run the installer and answer **"Yes"** to the _"Do you want to uninstall Open Voice OS?"_ question.

```shell
sh -c "curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer/main/installer.sh -o installer.sh && chmod +x installer.sh && sudo ./installer.sh --uninstall && rm installer.sh"
```
